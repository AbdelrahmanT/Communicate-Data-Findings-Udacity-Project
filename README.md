# (Exploring Ford's GoBike Dataset)
## by (Abdelrahman Talaat)


## Ford GoBike

> Data contains a lot of information about the rides but most of the information is redundant and hard to use like coordinates of the start and the end of the ride can be used to calculate distance like this Δψ = ln( tan(π/4 + φ2/2) / tan(π/4 + φ1/2) ), and I just couldnt understand the formula.

>So I made use of duration time of the ride, user type(customer/subscribes), gender , bike shares for all trip or not? and finally member birthyear and cleaned the rest of the unwanted columns


## Summary of Findings

> Most of users are from younger generations (1980s~2000s) and people who ride for longer durations and usually younger

>bike sharing for all trip doesnt coorelate with duration of the ride

>subscribes have less duration time but that also females usually have more duration time in all gender types

>people who bike share for all trips have the lowest duration

>other genders use "bike share for all trip" the most and men the least

## Key Insights for Presentation

 My plot were mostly polished and I just needed to put titles when needed and modify some of the xlabel and ylabels, and I explained a few of my discovering in the presentation like : 
> "Customers use the service for more duration than subscribes and female users use it the most on both user types, but people with other genders tend to use it almost as much as female users when they are subscribes and the lowest as customers"
> "most of bike rides' duration spans from 100seconds to 3000"
> "most of the users are from the younger generation and users who use the app"
and I wrote a note when the scales were unusual (logerthmic)
